IRONWORK

In the Real World, construction in steel is often a sensible and materially efficient choice.
This mod aims to make that the case in Minecraft too, through the addition of cheap iron structural elements.

Requires MC 1.19+, Fabric mod loader & Fabric API.

HOW DOES IT WORK
1. Make some Truss Elements with iron nuggets like you would make a stick with wood
2. Craft with these in different shapes to make your truss blocks

    CROSS BRACED TRUSS      WARREN TRUSS
            X X                 XXX
             X                   X
            X X                 X X

Simple as that.

There's just one small problem: your truss was painstakingly assembled with rivets, and whacking it with a pickaxe will
just destroy it. Oh well, it's cheap enough that you can just make another one.

(This mod is a learning exercise for me and I will add stuff as and when)
