IRONWORK

In the Real World, construction in steel is often a sensible and materially efficient choice.
This mod aims to make that the case in Minecraft too, through the addition of cheap iron structural elements.

Requires MC 1.19+, Fabric mod loader & Fabric API.

HOW DOES IT WORK

TRUSSES
1. Make some Truss Elements with iron nuggets like you would make a stick with wood
2. Craft with these in different shapes to make your truss blocks

    CROSS BRACED TRUSS      WARREN TRUSS
            X X                 XXX
             X                   X
            X X                 X X

CORRUGATED SHEETS

1. Use 3 iron nuggets horizontally to make the sheets, which can be placed like (and connect to) glass and iron bars.
2. Use these in the usual shape to make slabs and stairs, or as below to make blocks:

    CORRUGATED PANEL BLOCK
            XXX
            XXX

Simple as that.

There's just one small problem: your truss was painstakingly assembled with rivets, and whacking it with a pickaxe will
just destroy it. Oh well, it's cheap enough that you can just make another one.

(This mod is a learning exercise for me and I will add stuff as and when)
